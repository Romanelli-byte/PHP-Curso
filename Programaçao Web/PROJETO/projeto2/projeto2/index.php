		<h2>Psicologia</h2>
		<p>Psicologia é o estudo do comportamento e as funções mentais. A psicologia tem
		como objetivo imediato a compreensão de grupos e indivíduos tanto pelo estabelecimento
		de princípios universais como pelo estudo de casos específicos, e tem, segundo alguns,como
		objetivo final o benefício geral da sociedade.</p>
		<p>The machine became known as the Draisienne (or "hobby horse"). It was made entirely of wood. This enjoyed a short lived popularity as a fad, not being practical for transportation in any other place than a well maintained pathway such as in a park or garden.</p>
		<p>The next appearance of a two-wheeled riding machine was in 1865, when pedals were applied directly to the front wheel. This machine was known as the velocipede (meaning "fast foot") as well as the "bone shaker," since it's wooden structure combined with the cobblestone roads of the day made for an extremely uncomfortable ride. They also became a fad and indoor riding academies, similar to roller rinks, could be found in large cities.</p>
